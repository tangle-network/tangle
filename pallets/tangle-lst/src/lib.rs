//! # Nomination Pools for Liquid Staking

//! A pallet that allows members to delegate their stake to nominating pools. A nomination pool acts
//! as a nominator and nominates validators on behalf of its members.

//! ## Key Terms

//! * pool id: A unique identifier for each pool. Set to u32.
//! * bonded pool: Tracks the distribution of actively staked funds. See [`BondedPool`] and
//!   [`BondedPoolInner`].
//! * reward pool: Tracks rewards earned by actively staked funds. See [`RewardPool`] and
//!   [`RewardPools`].
//! * unbonding sub pools: Collection of pools at different phases of the unbonding lifecycle. See
//!   [`SubPools`] and [`SubPoolsStorage`].
//! * members: Accounts that are members of pools. See [`PoolMember`] and [`PoolMembers`].
//! * roles: Administrative roles of each pool, capable of controlling nomination and the state of
//!   the pool.
//! * point: A unit of measure for a member's portion of a pool's funds. Points initially have a
//!   ratio of 1 (as set by `POINTS_TO_BALANCE_INIT_RATIO`) to balance, but this can change as
//!   slashing occurs.
//! * kick: The act of a pool administrator forcibly ejecting a member.
//! * bonded account: A key-less account id derived from the pool id that acts as the bonded
//!   account.
//! * reward account: A similar key-less account that is set as the `Payee` account for the bonded
//!   account for all staking rewards.
//! * change rate: The rate at which pool commission can be changed. A change rate consists of a
//!   `max_increase` and `min_delay`, dictating the maximum percentage increase that can be applied
//!   to the commission per number of blocks.
//! * throttle: An attempted commission increase is throttled if the attempted change falls outside
//!   the change rate bounds.

//! ## Usage

//! ### Join

//! An account can stake funds with a nomination pool by calling [`Call::join`].

//! ### Claim rewards

//! After joining a pool, a member can claim rewards by calling [`Call::claim_payout`].

//! A pool member can also set a `ClaimPermission` with [`Call::set_claim_permission`], to allow
//! other members to permissionlessly bond or withdraw their rewards by calling
//! [`Call::bond_extra_other`] or [`Call::claim_payout_other`] respectively.

//! ### Leave

//! To leave, a member must take two steps:

//! 1. Call [`Call::unbond`] to start the unbonding process for all or a portion of their funds.
//! 2. Once [`sp_staking::StakingInterface::bonding_duration`] eras have passed, call
//!    [`Call::withdraw_unbonded`] to withdraw any funds that are free.

//! ### Slashes

//! Slashes are distributed evenly across the bonded pool and the unbonding pools from slash era+1
//! through the slash apply era. Any member who either unbonded or was actively bonded in this range
//! of eras will be affected by the slash. A member is slashed pro-rata based on its stake relative
//! to the total slash amount.

//! ### Administration

//! A pool can be created with the [`Call::create`] or [`Call::create_with_pool_id`] calls. Once
//! created, the pool's nominator or root user must call [`Call::nominate`] to start nominating.

//! Similar to [`Call::nominate`], [`Call::chill`] will chill the pool in the staking system, and
//! [`Call::pool_withdraw_unbonded`] will withdraw any unbonding chunks of the pool bonded account.

//! To help facilitate pool administration, the pool has one of three states (see [`PoolState`]):
//! Open, Blocked, or Destroying.

//! A pool has 4 administrative roles (see [`PoolRoles`]): Depositor, Nominator, Bouncer, and Root.

//! ### Commission

//! A pool can optionally have a commission configuration, set by the `root` role with
//! [`Call::set_commission`] and claimed with [`Call::claim_commission`]. Commission is subject to
//! a global maximum and a change rate, which can be set with [`Call::set_commission_max`] and
//! [`Call::set_commission_change_rate`] respectively.

//! ### Dismantling

//! A pool is destroyed once all members have fully unbonded and withdrawn, and the depositor has
//! fully unbonded and withdrawn.

//! ## New Features

//! ### Liquid Staking Tokens

//! The pallet now supports the creation of liquid staking tokens for each pool. When a member joins
//! a pool, they receive liquid staking tokens representing their share of the pool. These tokens
//! can be transferred or used in other DeFi applications while the underlying stake remains bonded.

//! ### Pool Creation with Specific ID

//! Pools can now be created with a specific ID using the [`Call::create_with_pool_id`] function.
//! This allows for more flexible pool management and integration with external systems.

//! ### Adjustable Pool Deposit

//! The [`Call::adjust_pool_deposit`] function allows for topping up the deficit or withdrawing the
//! excess Existential Deposit (ED) from the pool's reward account. This ensures that the pool
//! always has the correct ED, even if the ED requirement changes over time.
