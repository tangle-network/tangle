		// balance, and are thus below within the range of total_issuance. In the worse case
		// scenario, for `saturating_from_rational`, we have:

		//
		// Thus, adding two values of type reward counter should be safe for ages in a chain like
		// Polkadot. The important note here is that `reward_pool.last_recorded_reward_counter` only
		// ever accumulates, but its semantics imply that it is less than total_issuance, when
		// represented as `FixedU128`, which means it is less than `total_issuance * 10^18`.
		//
		// * accuracy notes regarding `checked_from_rational` collapsing to zero, meaning that no
		//   reward can be claimed:
		//
		// largest `bonded_points`, such that the reward counter is non-zero, with `FixedU128` will
		// be when the payout is being computed. This essentially means `payout/bonded_points` needs
		// to be more than 1/1^18. Thus, assuming that `bonded_points` will always be less than `10
		// * dot_total_issuance`, if the reward_counter is the smallest possible value, the value of
		//   the
		// reward being calculated is:
		//
		// x / 10^20 = 1/ 10^18
		//
		// x = 100
		//
		// which is basically 10^-8 DOTs. See `smallest_claimable_reward` for an example of this.
