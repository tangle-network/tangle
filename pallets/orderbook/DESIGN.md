# Tangle Network Orderbook Design

## Overview

The orderbook pallet is designed to manage compute resource trading in a decentralized manner, supporting atomic matching of multiple resource types (compute, memory, storage, network) across operators.

## Core Requirements

### Resource Management

1. **Resource Types**
    - Compute
    - Memory
    - Storage
    - Network
    - All resource types must be handled atomically in trades

### Order Types

1. **Bid Orders (Service Requests)**

    - Must specify requirements for all needed resource types
    - Can target specific operators or be open to any operator
    - Include minimum duration and maximum price constraints

2. **Ask Orders (Operator Offerings)**
    - Operators must provide offerings for ALL resource types
    - Include collateral requirements
    - Specify minimum duration and pricing for each resource

### Matching Requirements

1. **Atomic Execution**

    - Orders must be matched across ALL resource types simultaneously
    - All resources must come from the same operator(s)
    - Partial fills only allowed if ALL resource requirements can be met

2. **Price Discovery**
    - Support for price discovery across all resource types
    - Operators can update prices for their offerings
    - Market-based pricing for each resource type

### Operator Management

1. **Registration**

    - Operators must register with collateral
    - Must provide offerings for all resource types
    - Can specify minimum durations and resource constraints

2. **Updates**
    - Can update resource offerings and prices
    - Can adjust collateral amounts
    - Must maintain offerings for all resource types

### Market Structure

1. **Order Books**

    - Separate order books for each resource type
    - Orders linked across books for atomic execution
    - Price-time priority within each book

2. **Matching Engine**
    - Cross-resource order matching
    - Validation of operator capabilities
    - Atomic execution of trades

## Future Considerations

1. **Advanced Order Types**

    - Conditional orders
    - Time-bound orders
    - Auction-style orders

2. **Market Making**

    - Incentives for liquidity provision
    - Spread management
    - Volume-based rewards

3. **Risk Management**

    - Dynamic collateral requirements
    - Reputation systems
    - Slashing conditions

4. **Performance Optimization**
    - Efficient cross-book matching
    - Order book compression
    - State management optimization

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Basic Functionality**

    - Core order types
    - Basic operator registration
    - Simple matching engine

2. **Phase 2: Market Mechanisms**

    - Price discovery
    - Advanced order types
    - Market making incentives

3. **Phase 3: Risk and Performance**
    - Risk management systems
    - Performance optimizations
    - Advanced market features

## Notes

-   Implementation should be deferred until market demand is validated
-   Focus on simpler service request models initially
-   Gather user feedback on pricing and matching requirements
-   Consider integration with existing service management systems
