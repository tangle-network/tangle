# Service Marketplace System Design Prompt

## Core Components

1. **Service Request Types**

-   Direct requests to specific operators
-   Open market with dynamic participation
-   Time-bounded auctions
-   Standing orderbook mechanics

2. **Dynamic Security Model**

-   Security pools for flexible collateral
-   Dynamic operator participation
-   Asset-specific security requirements
-   Join/leave mechanics for operators

3. **Market Mechanisms**

-   Continuous orderbook for standard services
-   Auctions for specialized requirements
-   Price discovery through market forces
-   Automated matching and service creation

## Key Abstractions

```rust
// Market mechanisms for service creation
enum MarketMechanism {
    Direct { ... } // Direct operator selection
    OrderBook { ... } // Standing orders with price matching
    TimedAuction { ... } // Time-bounded price discovery
}
// Dynamic security management
struct SecurityPool {
    asset: Asset,
    participants: Map<AccountId, Balance>,
    requirements: SecurityRequirements
}
// Market order representation
struct MarketOrder {
    operator: AccountId,
    price: Balance,
    security_commitment: SecurityCommitment,
    expiry: BlockNumber
}
```

## Design Principles

1. Support multiple service creation patterns
2. Enable market-driven pricing
3. Maintain security and reliability
4. Allow dynamic participation
5. Automate matching where possible
