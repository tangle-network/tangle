//! # Tangle Multi Asset Delegation Pallet
//!
//! This crate provides the delegation framework for the Tangle network, enabling the delegation of
//! assets to operators for earning rewards.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - **Operators**: Operators are entities within the Tangle network that can receive delegated
//!   assets from delegators. They manage these assets, perform jobs and generate rewards for
//!   delegators.
//! - **Deposits**: Depositors must first reserve (deposit) their assets before they can delegate
//!   them to operators. This ensures that the assets are locked and available for delegation.
//! - **Delegation**: Delegation is the process where delegators assign their deposited assets to
//!   operators to earn rewards.
//!
//! ## Workflow for Delegators
//!
//! 1. **Deposit**: Before a delegator can delegate assets to an operator, they must first deposit
//!    the desired amount of assets. This reserves the assets in the delegator's account.
//! 2. **Delegate**: After depositing assets, the delegator can delegate these assets to an
//!    operator. The operator then manages these assets, and the delegator can earn rewards from the
//!    operator's activities.
//! 3. **Unstake**: If a delegator wants to reduce their delegation, they can schedule a unstake
//!    request. This request will be executed after a specified delay, ensuring network stability.
//! 4. **withdraw Request**: To completely remove assets from delegation, a delegator must submit an
//!    withdraw request. Similar to unstake requests, withdraw requests also have a delay before
//!    they can be executed.
//!
//! ## Workflow for Operators
//!
//! - **Join Operators**: An account can join as an operator by depositing a minimum stake amount.
//!   This stake is reserved and ensures that the operator has a stake in the network.
//! - **Leave Operators**: Operators can leave the network by scheduling a leave request. This
//!   request is subject to a delay, during which the operator's status changes to 'Leaving'.
//! - **Stake More**: Operators can increase their stake to strengthen their stake in the network.
//! - **Stake Less**: Operators can schedule a stake reduction request, which is executed after a
//!   delay.
//! - **Go Offline/Online**: Operators can change their status to offline if they need to
//!   temporarily stop participating in the network, and can come back online when ready.
